Picture this: you enter a record store on a late afternoon to look for new music and can't help but be mesmerized by the dazzling art that's everywhere - on vinyl casings, CD covers, on the walls. When you take a closer look, you notice how different and diverse each piece is, much like in a museum. You unlock your phone to do some quick research on different typography and design choices, but can't seem to find anything specific.

This website is all about typefaces as seen on album covers. An album title can tell you a lot about the artist's intentions and creative concept overall, and oftentimes this aspect of design gets overlooked by potential buyers and even critics. You will find within these articles an analysis on how typography has been used to develop effective covers throughout a wide range of genres, as well as how well certain typefaces sell when they appear on a certain product.

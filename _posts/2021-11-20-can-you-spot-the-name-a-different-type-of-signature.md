When you first pick up a record, you would expect to see at least one of these things: some sort of covert art, the name of the album and, lastly, the name of the artist. A well-designed album cover combines typography, imagery and color to create a visual representation of the music within. Usually, this is the artists’ chance to add a personal touch to their work, making it not only unique but easier to recognize by fans and new-listeners alike. 

The role of album covers has changed as soon as we entered the era of digitalization, thus becoming a complementary piece of art that accompanies the album rather than a form of identifying the singer’s work. Especially during the last decade, performers have stopped using bold, traditional typefaces, integrating them within the artwork - sometimes leaving text off entirely. 

#### Thank U, Next - Ariana Grande (2019)

At first glance, Ariana’s fifth studio album *Thank U, Next* showcases an upside down analog image of the artist - and nothing else. However, after taking a closer look, one can discover the name of the album literally graffitied on her neck.  Hunter Schwartz explains in a Twitter post: 

> “during the Thank U, Next era, she used a ton of mismatched fonts to compliment the magazine clipping look of the Burn Book in the “thank u, next” music video”. 

Grande revealed the cover in a Twitter post a couple of months before the actual release, writing:  

> “brian (Brian Nicholson) painted me. fredo (Alfredo Flores)  shot me. made with tru, deep friendship and love. just like music”. 

This unique way of presenting the album showcases Ariana’s way of reflecting the theme of the album. 

#### When It’s Dark Out - G-Eazy (2015)

Continuing the theme of graffiti and street art, this time we see the words “*these things happen when it’s dark out”* painted on the back of a jacket that G-Eazy’s wearing on the cover. The handwritten text encompasses the vibe of the album, in which the artist “brings light to his struggles” (Adelle Platon, Billboard, 2015). The distressed looking letters give the impression of anger and despair, as they almost look like they’ve been scratched in stone or madly scribbled on paper. 

#### Astroworld - Travis Scott (2018)

The artwork on Travis’ third studio album poses the perfect example of how the actual name of the album is showcased by using imagery rather than words. Photographer David LaChapelle shot the cover, “featuring a golden inflatable of the rapper’s head as the entrance of an amusement park”. The title is named after the now-defunct theme park *Six Flags Astroworld,* resulting in a great metaphor used on the cover of the album. 

#### DNCE - DNCE (2016)

The self-titled studio album by American band DNCE features a rather interesting cover: the band members captured in what seems to be a Renaissance painting of the Royal Family, dressed as funk-pop performers. On a painting, DNCE appears to be written with a paint-marker, resembling the band’s almost rebellious take on their sound.
